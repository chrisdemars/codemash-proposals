# Incorporating Screen Readers into React Native Development for Improved Accessibility

VoiceOver is a screen reader built into every Mac and iOS device, allowing users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with their devices using only sound. In this talk, we will explore how to utilize VoiceOver on an iPhone to improve the accessibility of a React Native mobile application. By implementing VoiceOver in a React Native app, developers can ensure that their app is accessible to a wider range of users. We will cover best practices for testing and debugging with VoiceOver, as well as strategies for ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience for all users.
