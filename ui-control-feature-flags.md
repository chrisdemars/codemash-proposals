# Building Flexible UIs with Feature Flags

Feature flags are a valuable tool for managing the rollout and experimentation of new UI changes. In this talk, we will provide a hands-on demonstration of how to implement feature flags in a UI context, including creating and managing flags, targeting specific user groups, and collecting feedback. We will also discuss real-world examples of how feature flags have been used to successfully control UI changes and improve the development process.
